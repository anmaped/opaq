Supported features:
- Browser-based graphical user interface to control light and power devices of aquarium and pond systems
- Customizable programming actions for nodes such as automation of CO2 injection and temperature management
- Node-based architecture (nodes are authentic, secured with SHA256 signatures)
- Energy cost management that instruct you how to avoid wasting energy

Opaq devices available:

Opaq c1 | Opaq n1 | Opaq n2

the main controller device ![Opaq C1 Frame](/hardware/opac_c1/v1.1/top.png?raw=true "Opaq C1 Frame") | the four channel dimmer device capable to connect with any led lamp (several settings available) ![Opaq n1 Frame](/hardware/opac_n1/v2.1/top.png?raw=true "Opaq n1 Frame") | the power outlet controller node for 220v devices up to 2400w

Expected features:
- Support for sensor logging (temperature, humidity, light intensity, PH, Nitrates(NO3))
- Management of peristaltic pumps for automatic fertilization regimes for fresh and salt water aquariums
- Dedicated settings for aquarium and pond systems (pond systems can be controlled by Opaq C1 to automatically perform programmable water changes, and feed fishes; pumps are controlled by programmable actions based on the information provided by water level sensor nodes)

Expected Hardware:
- Opaq N3 (the node for probing PH, light intensity and humidity)
